## React Tag Editor Widget
The following is a fun little widget that can be used to experiment with new technologies while really helping get a full spectrum of all your skills. All the setup should be done and ready to go. All you have to do is dig in and start coding.

Navigate to `components/TagEditor/TagEditor.jsx` to begin.

You may use any additional npm modules / components that are not included already to complete the widget.

`React` is the only thing you need to use.

Additionally `redux` and `react-redux` have been included in the `package.json` to save you the hassle of doing it if you prefer to use `redux` for state management.


## To Get Started

##### Install all dependencies:
`npm install`

##### Run the app:
`npm start`
